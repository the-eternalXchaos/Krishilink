This folder is now legacy. All real live chat code (screens, controllers, services, models) has been migrated to the canonical architecture under:

lib/src/features/chat/

Only this README_LEGACY.txt and export shims should remain here during migration. If you find any real implementation files in this folder, please move them to the appropriate canonical location as per ARCHITECTURE.md.

For details, see the migration plan in ARCHITECTURE.md.
